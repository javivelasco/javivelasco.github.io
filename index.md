# Hi, I’m Javi.

I’m a software engineer living in Madrid. I feel programming as an art and I strongly believe in the value of well crafted software. Currently, I work on the frontend team at [SocialBro](http://www.socialbro.com) building an awesome user experience.

But not everything is about software. I [write](http://javivelasco.com/blog), travel, read books and comics and [teach](http://www.ironhack.com) from time to time. You can find me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/javivelasco) and [GitHub](http://www.github.com/javivelasco) or [contact](mailto:javier.velasco86@gmail.com) directly through email.
