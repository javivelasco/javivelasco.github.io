# Hi, I’m Javi.

I’m a software engineer living in Madrid. I feel programming as an art and I strongly believe in the value of well crafted software. Currently, I work on the frontend team at SocialBro building an awesome user experience.

But not everything is about software. I travel, read books and comics, [learn]() and [teach]() from time to time. You can find me on [Twitter]() and [GitHub]()
