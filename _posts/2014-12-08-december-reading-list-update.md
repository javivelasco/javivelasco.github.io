Two months and a half ago, still being not familiar with traffic in such big city like Madrid, I though I could drive to work everyday early in the morning. I cannot imagine how wrong I was... eventually, I decided it was better to ride the **subway**.

But, like Monty Python's said:

> Always look on the bright side of life

and certainly it feels great to have time to read in my way to work. I had had the chance of finishing several books that were listed in my [last update](http://blog.javivelasco.com/reading-list-update/), and a couple extra. I'm going to **briefly** speak about them and write down the list in its current status.

**[Understanding the four rules of simple design](https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign)** by [Corey Haynes](https://twitter.com/coreyhaines) was a very nice reading. Corey has been a facilitator in *coderetreat* workshops in which participants faced different approachs to resolve [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The book explores, by using examples, different patterns emerged during those retreats, keeping in mind the 4 rules of design originally proposed by [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/kentbeck):

1. Tests pass
2. Expresses Intent
3. No duplication (DRY)
4. Small

This way, the author talks about how test names should influence the object's API, DRY principle, how to replace procedural polymorphism, and much more. A great reading (and quite short) for both beginners and experts.

**[Hacking your education](http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Your-Education-Lectures-Thousands/dp/0399159967)** by [Dale J. Stephens](https://twitter.com/DaleJStephens) is definitely a book everybody should read, specially software professionals. In our proffesion we are *damned* to adapt or die, and this is a book about education out of school; jus as we do. Dale tells his experience as a college dropout and also the story of a lot of succesful people who made it by doing what they were passionate about, and not what they were supposed to do (like [Alex MacCaw](http://alexmaccaw.com/) or [Ryan Holiday](http://www.ryanholiday.net/)). A lot of advice that will help you set your mind towards a learning attitude.

**[How Google Works](http://www.amazon.es/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582344)** by [Eric Schmidt](https://twitter.com/ericschmidt) & [Jonathan Rosenberg](https://twitter.com/jjrosenberg) is being a controversial book in the United States. Not everybody agree with some of the exposed ideas there. I think it was not the best read for me at that moment. It's too focused on how to build a successful company which is not what I do nowadays. Our [Traity](www.traity.com) peers encouraged us all to read it in order to have a starting point for a conversation about company culture. I have to say it helped. In general terms it's an enjoyable reading, but it can become repetitive and too focused on the good points of Google. I'm quite sure that bad things happened too but they were not mentioned.

I can say nothing about **[The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)**, by [Andrew Hunt](https://twitter.com/PragmaticAndy) and [Dave Thomas](https://twitter.com/pragdave), not already said by someone else. It's a classic, just like [Clean Code](http://www.amazon.es/Clean-code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882). A must read for developers and software professionals in general. You will learn about programmer philosophy, what is to be pragmatic, design patterns, how to communicate and flexibility of software among many other topics. If you keep a reading list like me, this book should be the next to read.

**[Effective Ruby](http://www.effectiveruby.com/)** by [Peter J. Jones](https://twitter.com/contextualdev) is the most technical book on this list. Our stack in [Traity](www.traity.com) is mostly written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) so I'm working with it everyday. I wanted to improve the way I work with Ruby and understand every single aspect of the language and avoiding *programming by coincidence*. This is not a book for beginners, you should be already familiar with Ruby to get the most of it. That was my case and I learned deeply how inheritance work, how to optimize memory usage, metaprogramming, effective use of collections, etc. A funny and productive reading totally recommended if you work (or plan to work) with Ruby language.

And that's all I read lately! I need to **populate** my reading list and I have changed the order of the last two books from my last update and I've inserted another one that I'm reading from time to time. Anyway, here is it:

1. [What if?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions](http://www.amazon.es/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/0544272994) by [Randall Munroe](http://xkcd.com/about/)
2. [Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future](http://www.amazon.com/Nine-Algorithms-That-Changed-Future/dp/0691158193) by John MacCormick
3. [Software Architecture for Developers](https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers) by [Simon Brown](https://twitter.com/simonbrown)
4. [Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable OO Software](http://www.amazon.es/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612) by [The Gang of Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
5. [Hardboiled Web Design](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/hardboiled-web-design) by [Andy Clarke](https://twitter.com/malarkey)

I have to say Randall Munroe's book can be read combined with other because chapters are completely self contained. My plan is to start number 2 and switch with 1 from time to time.
